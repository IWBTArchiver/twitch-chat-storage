I feel lots of room for improvement though, maybe sub-50 is in reach.\nWorld Record as of 3/20/2017, beating mqpg&#39;s time of 1:09:07!\nMost splits in this run went terrifically. Major time was lost in 3 places. At least 2 minutes were lost each on the final save in the 3rd hub split of the 2nd hub, the 2nd to last save of the 3rd hub split in the 3rd hub, and the Mario brothers avoidance in the 2nd area of the 2nd hub. Only a very small number of other places have timesaves close to a minute.","chapters":[{"id":"","startMilliseconds":0,"lengthMilliseconds":3690000,"type":"GAME_CHANGE","description":"I Wanna Be the Guy","subDescription":"","thumbnailUrl":null,"gameId":"20716","gameDisplayName":"I Wanna Be the Guy","gameBoxArtUrl":"https://static-cdn.jtvnw.net/ttv-boxart/20716_IGDB-40x53.jpg"}],"streamer":{"name":"GeoGeo222","login":"geogeo222","id":40531267}},"embedded_data":{"twitch_badges":{}},"messages":[]}
